# Terrain-Generator
Inspired by https://github.com/mewo2/terrain I decided to ES6ify the code and add in a basic DatGUI interface to play around with the landscape generation. I tried to add documentation as I cleaned up the code, but I am still trying to understand how it all works so it will take some time. Should be easy to play with just download and open up the index.html file. Enjoy!
